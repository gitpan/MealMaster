      Title: HOT OR COLD LEEK SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables, Tabasco
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Leek, (About 8 Ounces) *
      2 tb Olive Oil
      1    Onion, (About 6 Ounces),
           Peeled And Sliced
      6 c  Chicken Stock
  1 1/2 lb Potatoes, Peeled And Cut
           Into 2-Inch Cubes
           Salt To Taste (Depending On
           Saltiness Of Stock)
    1/2 ts Freshly Ground Black Pepper
           Bread Croutons, For Garnish

MMMMM-----------------------FOR COLD SOUP----------------------------
  2 1/2 c  Cold Milk
      6 tb Chives, Chopped
    1/4 ts Tabasco Sauce
 
  Remove the root end and any damaged outer leaves from the leek, but
  leave the remainder of the leaves intact. Split the leek in half
  lengthwise, and cut it into 1/2-inch pieces. Clean the leek by
  immersing the pieces in a bowl filled with cold water.  Lift the
  pieces from the water and place them in a sieve to drain. Heat the
  oil in a pot. When hot, add the leek and sliced onion, and cook over
  medium heat for about 5 minutes, until they soften and begin to brown
  lightly. Add the stock, potatoes, salt and pepper, and bring to the
  boil. Boil for 30 to 40 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.
  Strain off most of the cooking juices and reserve them. Add the
  solids with a little of the juices to the bowl of a food processor,
  and process briefly, just until pureed. (If too much liquid is added
  to the processor bowl, the mixture will become too foamy.) Stir the
  puree into the reserved juices. You should have about 7 cups. The hot
  soup can be served immediately, either plain or with croutons. FOR
  COLD SOUP: Cool the soup and stir in the milk, chives and Tabasco
  sauce. Serve cold. Serves 6. *If you cannot find leeks, add
  additional onions or scallions; the soup will be very good, although
  it won't have the unique taste that leeks give to soup. If using
  leeks or scallions, be sure to make use of the green as well as the
  white part of the vegetables, after trimming them first, of course,
  to eliminate any damaged or wilted sections. The green leaves lend
  color as well as taste and texture to the soup. Recipe from "Cuisine
  Economique" by Jacques Pepin. Source: Cuisine Economique - J. Pepin

           Salt
           Corn starch

      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 tb Cider vinegar
      2 tb Soya sauce
      1 tb Wine
    1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Peanuts
      2 tb Oil
 
  1. Cut chicken meat in sheets away from breast bone, slice into
  squares of 1x1". Dredge in a mixture of corn starch and salt on a
  piece of wax paper. Allow pieces to dry individually on wax paper
  about 20 minutes.
  
  2. Remove seeds from fresh peppers. Coarsely cut into strips. Reserve.
  
  3. Mix sugar, vinegar, soya sauce, wine together in a small bowl.
  Reserve.
  
  4. Heat oil in wok until smoking, add dredged chicken, stir fry on all
  sides. If oil is hot enough for chicken, pieces will not stick to wok.
  
  5. Add sugar and vinegar reserve, hot peppers. Place cover over wok.
  Add 1/2 cup water, cook over medium heat 5 minutes. Self gravy should
  form in the bottom of wok. Stir chicken in gravy so it will cook in
  gravy. Gravy should become gelatinous after 5 minutes of cooking. If
  it becomes too thick, thin gravy out with small amounts of water.
  
  6. Sprinle in 1 cup of peanuts, mix thoroughly.
  
  NOTE: Canned hot peppers are too soft to be used for this dish. If
  desired, dried cayenne peppers can be reconstituted for use. If you
  are fond of this dish, it is well to freeze your own hot peppers, in
  season.

      Title: HOT PEPPER VINEGAR
 Categories: Condiments
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     20    Hot peppers; fresh -- mixed
     50 ml Garlic
      1 tb Black peppercorns -- whole
      2 tb Cilantro -- dried
      1 qt Vinegar -- distilled white
 
  The above ingredients are approximations.  Vary them to control the
  flavor and heat content to your preference.
  
  Select a variety of hot peppers based on flavor and color. Stem them,
  and slit them open along the length of the pepper. Peel the garlic
  cloves and split them at least in half;in thirds if they are large.
  Put the peppers, garlic, peppercorns, and cilantro in a sterilized
  bottle with a tight fitting lid. Add the vinegar until the bottle is
  filled to the top and seal.
  
  Let the mixture sit for one week in a cool, dark place. Make sure to
  shake it gently at least once a day. Taste constantly, and enjoy the
  slowly building heat and flavor. At the end of the week, you can
  strain the mixture if you desire. Or, for a hotter brew, leave in the
  ingredients for another 1-3 weeks before straining.
  
  Better still is to leave in the ingredients, and to top off the
  vinegar with fresh as it is being used. When the heat and flavor
  starts to waver, strain the ingredients and replace with fresh ones.

      Title: HOT PRETZELS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Pretzels
 
      1 c  Water (105-115 degrees F)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
      2 tb Soft butter
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
      4 c  Water
      5 ts Baking soda
           Coarse salt (i.e. kosher)
 
  Combine water and yeast. Add 1 1/2 cup flour, butter, salt, and sugar
  and beat at least 3 minutes. Add remaining 1 1/4 cup flour and knead
  until dough is not sticky. Let rise in greased bowl until double.
  Punch down and divide into twelve pieces. Roll pieces into 18 inch
  long sticks with tapered ends. Loop into pretzel shape (helps to have
  a commercial pretzel handy if you can't remember what they look
  like). Place on greased baking sheet and let rise again until
  doubled. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F.
  
  Boil 4 cup water and 5 tsp baking soda (do not use aluminum pan) and
  lower each pretzel into the water with slotted spoon. Let stay in
  water about a minute or until they float. Return to greased cookie
  sheet and sprinkle with coarse salt.
  
  Bake until crispy and brown, about 12 minutes. Best eaten immediately
  but can be cooled and stored about a week.
  
  This looks like the recipe in Joy of Cooking, so I will give credit

      Title: HOT RED SNAPPER SOUP (KOREAN DOMI CHIGAE)
 Categories: Korean, Soups, Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 lb Lean beef (shoulder)
  1 1/2 lb Red snapper
      2    Scallions
      2    Cloves garlic
    1/2    Cake bean curd
      2 c  Water
      2 tb Kochu Chang
 
  A chigae is usually a hot soup comprised of several ingredients. In
  this case, meat has been cooked with fish, the one to impart body,
  the other to add flavor. Kochu Chang is red bean paste, which may be
  purchased at many Oriental food stores. If it is not available,
  Japanese miso sauce may be substituted.
  
  1.  Shred the beef into 2-inch lengths. Cut the red snapper across
  the body into 1 1/2-inch widths, leaving the bones inside. Cut the
  scallions into 2-inch cubes.
  
  2.  Arrange the pieces of fish on the bottom of a pot. Add the
  scallions, then the beef. Now add the garlic. Mix the kochu chang
  with water and pour it over the other ingredients. Bring to a boil,
  then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Just before serving
  add the bean curd and cook for 3 minutes.
  
  Variation: Instead of red snapper, use a 1 1/2 to 2-pound sea bass,
  or a 1-pound codfish, or 2 small lobsters.

      Title: HOT RUM TODDY
 Categories: Drinks, Alcohol
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 lb Dark brown sugar
    1/2 lb Butter, salted
      1 ts Nutmeg, ground
      1 ts Cinnamon, ground
      1 ts Cloves, ground
      1 ts White cardamom,
           -ground
           Dark rum, top-quality
           -(a standard "fifth"
           -will serve 12)
 
  MAKING THE BATTER:  Put all batter ingredients (everything but the
  rum) in a food processor and run it until the mixture turns creamy.
  Fold it down once with a rubber spatula to make sure the spices are
  blended in, and run the food processor some more.
  
  Scoop the mixture into a plastic container, and refrigerate. It will
  keep for many months in the refrigerator, even though it contains
  butter.
  
  MAKING THE DRINKS:  Fill a coffee mug half full of boiling water. The
  easiest way to do this is to put a mug of hot water in the microwave.
  If you don't have a microwave, then fill the mug with boiling water,
  pour it out, then fill it half full of boiling water.
  
  Add about 2 generous tablespoons of batter.  Stir until the batter
  dissolves in the hot water. I use a small wire whisk for this
  stirring.
  
  Add 2 jiggers (about 3 oz) of the best rum you can afford. When I
  make this in quantities for parties I like to use Myers Dark Rum.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Ultimate hot buttered rum recipe -- I started making hot buttered
  rum from a Trader Vic recipe 15 years ago, and I have gradually
  evolved it by adding more spices, more butter and less rum.
  
  The way you make a hot buttered rum is to add some "batter" to some
  rum, and heat it. I like to keep a made-up batch of the batter in the
  refrigerator in an old margarine tub. For parties I make up a fresh
  batch.
  
  *  One theory of hot-toddy making is that it is impossible to use too
  much batter, and you should keep stirring more in until you are bored
  with stirring. Another theory of hot-toddy making is that it is
  impossible to use too much rum, and that you should keep stirring in
  more until your friends panic.

      1 tb Rice wine
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      5 ts Sesame oil
      5 ts Soy sauce

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      1 tb Sesame seeds
  1 1/2 ts Hot bean paste
  1 1/2 ts Hoisin sauce
  1 1/2 ts Oyster sauce

MMMMM----------------------------BEEF---------------------------------
      1 ts Minced ginger
    2/3 lb Beef tenderloin
           -flank
           Peanut oil (2-4 T)
      4    Lettuce leaves
           -(or less; use
           -bok-choy if you
           -can get it)
 
  Mix together all of the marinade ingredients.  Slice the beef across
  the grain into thin, diagonal pieces (about the size of your smallest
  finger). Marinate for about half an hour.
  
  Heat the wok until a drop of water dropped into it dances around as it
  boils. Add enough oil to coat the wok and saute the ginger. Stir-fry
  the lettuce. Stir-fry the beef (in batches so the wok doesn't cool
  down too much).
  
  Reduce the heat.  Return the vegetables to the wok. Add the topping.
  Stir around until everything is mixed and heated evenly. Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very hot, very simple, very good beef stir-fry -- This recipe has
  been floating around for years back east, where it's also known as
  Hot Flaming Death.
  
  *  Also add any other vegetables that you feel like. Sliced carrots or
  broccoli are especially nice.
  
  *  Hot bean paste also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc. This
  is the main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care. Vary
  this ingredient to taste.

      Title: HOT SHINS
 Categories: Barbeque, Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     16 ea Chicken Drumsticks (2 /12 to
           -3 1/2 pounds)
    1/4 c  Flour
      2 ts Paprika
      1 ts Black pepper, ground
      1 ts White pepper, ground
      1 ts Cayenne pepper, ground
      1 ts Thyme, ground
      1 ts Garlic, powder
      1 ts Salt
 
  The day before you plan to serve these drumsticks, lay them out on a
  cutting board or butcher block and pierce them all over with a fork so
  that, when they are seasoned, the spices will permeate the meat
  nicely. Set aside.
  
  Measure into a Ziploc-type plastic bag the flour, paprika, black,
  white, and cayenne pepper, thyme, garlic powder, and salt. Close the
  bag and shake to blend the spice well.
  
  Add the drumsticks to the bag, zip it shut again, and shake until the
  drumsticks are thoroughly coated with the seasoning. Refrigerate
  overnight.
  
  The following day, about 2 hours before dinnertime, fire up your
  smoker and, when the coals are glowing, add some wet wood to the fire
  pan and fill the water pan halfway with hot water. Transfer the
  drumsticks from their bag to the grill and cover the smoker snugly.
  
  Smoke at 200 to 220 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the juice
  runs clear when the meat is pricked and the drums are lusciously
  tender.

      1 lb Chicken pieces
           - (wings or thighs)
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Scallions
    2/3 c  Oil, preferably peanut
      1    Dried red chile
           -halved lengthwise
      1 ts Oil
    1/2 ts Finely chopped ginger root
      1 ts Chili bean sauce; -=OR=-
    1/2 ts Chili powder
  1 1/3 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 ts Ground Sichuan peppercorns
           -Roasted, (optional)
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
 
  RUB THE CHICKEN PIECES with the salt and let them sit for about 30
  minutes. Cut the scallions into 2-inch pieces. Heat the 2/3 cup of
  oil in a wok or large skillet, and then add the dried chile to flavor
  the oil. When it turns black, turn the heat down. (At this point you
  may remove the chile or leave it in as the Chinese do.) Slowly brown
  the chicken pieces, a few at a time, skin-side down. Turn the chicken
  pieces over and brown the other side. Drain the cooked pieces on
  paper towels. Heat a clean wok or skillet and add 1 teaspoon oil. Fry
  in it the scallions, ginger and chili bean sauce (or chile powder),
  taking care not to have the heat too high or the sauce will burn. A
  few seconds later, add the chicken stock, Sichuan peppercorns, sugar
  and dark soy sauce. Then turn the heat down low, and add the chicken
  pieces. Cover, and finish cooking the chicken in this sauce, turning
  the pieces from time to time. This should take about 20-to-30
  minutes. Serve the chicken with the sauce, first removing any surface
  fat.
